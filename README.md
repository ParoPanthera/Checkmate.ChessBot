# ChessBot - Checkmate
Checkmate chessbot was made by me and my colleagues participating in intra college hackathon. We had to build a chessbot which would fight against other participating teams in my 2nd semester. This program won 1st place with stats: 50 wins, 15 draws, 1 losses, 0 token violation, and average time of 0.00398525.
